# Logo Setup Instructions

## Why the photo/logo is not showing:
The `al-islami.png` file doesn't exist in this folder yet.

## How to fix it:

### Option 1: Add your own logo
1. Save your logo as `al-islami.png`
2. Place it in this folder: `kareem-pdf-to-excel-main/assets/al-islami.png`
3. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels
4. Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG

### Option 2: Use the current placeholder
The application is currently showing a nice blue placeholder logo that says "AL-ISLAMI FOOD GROUP"

## Current Status:
✅ **Logo placeholder working** - Shows a professional blue logo
✅ **Borders removed** - Clean appearance without borders
✅ **Ready for your logo** - Just add the PNG file!

## File Structure:
```
kareem-pdf-to-excel-main/
└── assets/
    ├── LOGO_INSTRUCTIONS.md (this file)
    └── al-islami.png (add your logo here)
```

The logo will automatically appear once you add the PNG file!
